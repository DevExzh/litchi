# ADR 0008: Migration and verification

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-31

## Migration policy

The refactor is breaking but proceeds in dependency-ordered, continuously
buildable phases. There are no released compatibility shims.

1. Foundation: reduce `litchi-core`, add source/budget/selector/scalar/error
   contracts, neutral vocabulary crates, dependency checks, and API tests.
2. OOXML substrate: split `litchi-ooxml-common` and `litchi-drawingml` from the
   monolith while preserving raw unknown content.
3. OOXML vertical slices: migrate XLSX first to stress large-file and concurrent
   CRUD, PPTX next to prove DrawingML/shape semantics, and DOCX to prove
   story/style semantics. The three may overlap where dependencies allow.
4. Migrate XLSB onto `litchi-sheet` and shared DrawingML without depending on
   XLSX.
5. Split `litchi-ole-common` and `litchi-odraw`, then migrate XLS, PPT, and DOC
   onto the same neutral vocabularies while retaining binary-native models.
6. Replace the umbrella facade, delete the old monolith crates, and run the full
   support certification matrix.

Every phase supplies concise compile-tested golden paths and negative
compile-fail cases. Public API snapshots reject redundant prefixes and facade
type noise. No format is advertised as supported until required checklist rows
pass.

The first implementation slice establishes bounded scalars, selectors,
positional sources, hierarchical budgets, neutral word/sheet/slide vocabulary
crates, and executable dependency fences. Markup compatibility, shared document
properties, and external-workbook relationship vocabulary have moved into
`litchi-ooxml-common`; the format-independent DrawingML XML primitives have
moved into `litchi-drawingml`. The monolith remains only as a migration host and
`litchi-core` still carries explicitly fenced extraction debt.

The second implementation slice moves shared OOXML namespace, entity,
attribute, and bounded OMML scanning helpers into `litchi-ooxml-common`. It also
introduces the independent `litchi-xlsx` crate: the canonical workbook-catalog
parser now lives there, while the migration host contains only conversions to
its legacy internal records. `litchi-xlsx::Workbook` is an immutable `Send +
Sync` snapshot with lifetime-free sheet handles, content-derived flavor, a
deterministic one-visible-sheet baseline, and selector-first `Result<Option<_>>`
lookup by name or checked zero-based position. This was the first XLSX vertical
slice; lossless edit/patch commits remain migration work.

The third implementation slice adds the first semantic worksheet read path.
`litchi-sheet` rows, columns, and addresses now have checked constructors and
cannot represent coordinates outside the modern spreadsheet grid. A half-open
`Rect` stores its exclusive boundary separately, so it can cover the final row
and column without admitting a sentinel as a valid cell. Borrowed A1 lookup such
as `sheet.cell("A1")` is the semantic main entry; raw zero-based `(row, column)`
tuples remain convenient, and reusable checked `Address` values avoid repeated
validation in hot loops. Lookup returns `Result<Option<&Cell>>`: absence is
distinct from an explicitly stored `Cell::Empty`, and no `Index` implementation
converts a miss into a panic.

Worksheet payloads load on first use into hidden thread-safe snapshot caches.
The parser streams into a row-major compact sparse slice, resolves shared
strings through cheaply cloned immutable text, expands shared-formula storage
records, retains exact numeric lexical forms, and keeps formula cache origin and
freshness separate. Sparse `cells(range)` traversal and stored extent are
implemented; the eighth slice later separates declared, content, and direct-
style extents. Fully resolved formatted extents including row/column defaults,
rich-text formatting, merge coverage, dynamic-array spill states, shared-style
definition editing, dense budgeted grids, cache eviction, and operation budgets
remain open, as does replacing remaining parser `Invalid` messages with the
full structured context taxonomy. The current non-evicting cache is therefore a
safe migration step, not the weighted-cache design promised by ADR 0005.

The parser's Office-profile limits follow the checked-in `[MS-OE376]`
conformance notes: row and column grid bounds, non-decreasing row order, cell
style indexes through 65,490, one-based cell/value metadata indexes below 2³¹,
32,767-character cell and shared-string limits, bounded shared-string run/count
hints, required shared-formula indexes, and a false formula `bx` flag. Advisory
shared-string counts size allocations but never override the parsed items.

The fourth implementation slice adds transactional ordinary-cell writes to the
new `litchi-xlsx` crate. `Workbook::edit()` creates isolated state and
`Edit::sheet(selector)` retains the checked name/position lookup contract.
`SheetEdit` exposes the short verbs `set`, `clear`, and `remove`; dropping an
edit rolls it back, while `commit` validates every rewritten worksheet before
publishing a new immutable workbook. The source snapshot is never changed.
Plain strings remain inert text, formulas require an explicit checked
`Formula`, floating-point numbers reject non-finite values, and `t="d"` values
use a checked `Date` type that retains the original ISO 8601 lexical form.
`clear` retains the cell record and local metadata; `remove` deletes that
record without shifting surrounding cells. Clearing a cell created earlier in
the same transaction therefore produces an explicit empty record, while
clearing a missing source cell is a no-op.

The transaction structurally clones the OPC graph while sharing clean part
payloads through immutable `Arc` storage. It rewrites only affected worksheet
rows and cells, preserving untouched bytes plus touched-cell styles, metadata,
unknown attributes, and unrelated children. It deliberately refuses edits
whose semantics are not yet proven: signed packages, protected sheets, cells
covered by data validation or a merged-cell follower, multi-cell formula
groups, markup-compatibility-controlled sheet data, and unknown cell payloads
except explicit removal. Literal SpreadsheetML escape sequences and XML control
characters are encoded without changing their text meaning.

Successful commits return semantic before/after changes and an in-memory
source-checked reversible patch. Private part deltas share their byte owners;
application checks expected source bytes and relationship state before
mutation. It retains exact changed-part bytes and relationship fields, but does
not claim byte-identical ZIP containers. Cell edits remove an existing
calculation-chain relationship and part, set
calculation properties for a full refresh, and retain the removed graph in the
inverse patch. The boolean spellings used for calculation properties follow
the Office compatibility notes in `[MS-OE376]` §2.1.599. This is intentionally
not yet the format-independent deterministic patch wire representation required
by ADR 0003.

The fifth implementation slice makes ordinary-cell edit planning composable
across threads without exposing locks. Multiple `Edit` values may be prepared
independently from cheap clones of the same immutable workbook snapshot and
then joined. The initial `join` accepted only exact snapshot lineage and
cell-disjoint write sets; the seventh slice refines this to disjoint effect
facets on a cell. It checks ordered maps without materializing a combined copy,
then moves the incoming edit's action maps into the accepted edit. It does not
use last-writer-wins behavior.

An overlap returns a deterministic `ConflictSet` grouped by developer-facing
sheet name and checked position, with ordered cell addresses. A lineage mismatch
is distinct from an overlap. In either case the accepted edit remains unchanged
and `JoinError` returns ownership of the rejected edit, so error handling cannot
silently discard prepared work. `JoinError` also converts into the crate's
boxed error variant for concise `?` use. Workbook opening now rejects two
logical sheets that alias the same physical sheet part; otherwise apparently
disjoint logical edits could overwrite one another during commit.

The fifth-slice example artifact was produced by joining two independently
prepared edits. Microsoft Excel for macOS opened the generated package without
a repair or compatibility dialog, reported a used range of `A1:B1`, and exposed
`Revenue` at `A1` and `42` at `B1`. This verifies native open and cell values for
that artifact only; it is not evidence of native resave fidelity, contention,
or performance.

The sixth implementation slice replaces archive-sized buffering in the shared
OPC output path. `PackageWriter` now emits ZIP records directly to any
sequential `Write` sink; seeking is not required, and the memory-returning
`to_bytes` path remains an explicit choice. A caller-owned sink failure after
output begins returns typed `IncompleteOutput` context with the accepted byte
count. `litchi-xlsx::Workbook` exposes the concise `write_to` and `save` entry
points over this substrate.

Ordinary filesystem save now writes a sibling temporary artifact, finalizes and
flushes the ZIP, synchronizes the file, and only then replaces the destination.
It preserves an existing regular file's permissions, refuses symbolic-link and
non-file destinations, cleans up a failed temporary artifact, and synchronizes
the parent directory where the platform supports it. Tests inject a failure
after a partial temporary write and prove the original bytes remain unchanged.
A separate 2 MiB incompressible-payload test uses a non-seekable sink that
rejects any write over 64 KiB; direct streaming succeeds and an injected sink
failure reports the exact 128 accepted bytes. These are functional output-shape
checks, not allocation, latency, or throughput measurements.

Desktop Excel for macOS opened the joined-edit artifact written through the new
atomic streaming path without a repair or compatibility dialog and reported
`Revenue` at `A1`, `42` at `B1`, and the expected `A1:B1` used range. This adds
native-open evidence for the physical save path only; it does not certify crash
durability on every filesystem or native resave fidelity.

The seventh implementation slice makes SpreadsheetML shared cell formats
first-class without exposing their numeric `s` identifiers. The workbook
validates that there is at most one internal styles relationship with the
required content type, then lazily preprocesses `styles.xml` through the common
markup-compatibility engine and validates the direct `cellXfs` collection.
Counts and cell references are bounded against the checked-in `[MS-OE376]`
profile: §2.1.599 defines `c/@s` as a `cellXfs` index through 65,490, while
§2.1.728 limits the `cellXfs` collection itself to 65,430 records. Missing,
empty, duplicate, count-mismatched, and out-of-range tables/references fail
before the affected style is observed or a style-dependent edit is published.
`Workbook::new()` now includes a minimal valid base style resource.

`Workbook::styles()` returns a compact immutable `Styles` view;
`Styles::base`, checked `get`, and iteration return cheap `Style` handles.
The ordinary semantic entry is `Sheet::style(cell)`, while numeric position is
the secondary import/diagnostic path. `Sheet::local_style` distinguishes a
missing cell, an existing cell with no local style, and an explicit shared
style reference; `Sheet::style` separately resolves the omitted local
reference to the base cell format. Handles carry exact snapshot ownership,
which pins the snapshot used by queries such as fan-out, plus a separate
pointer-identity lineage for the immutable shared-style table. That resource
lineage is retained across descendant cell-only commits, so handles and opaque
patch keys remain safely reusable while the table is unchanged; unrelated
tables are rejected by a typed error and cannot compare equal accidentally. No
public constructor or getter exposes the physical SpreadsheetML index. When a
source-checked patch is replayed onto a separately opened byte-identical
workbook, its reported style states are rebound to that target table's lineage
so every returned key resolves against the resulting snapshot. A patch whose
before/after state contains an explicit shared style also retains a shared byte
guard for the styles resource; replay against a different relationship target
or table is rejected rather than reinterpreting the opaque key.

`Style::fan_out` reports the number of stored worksheet cells whose effective
cell format is that resource, including implicit base-format use. It
deliberately does not guess at unstored grid positions or row/column defaults.
`SheetEdit::style` retargets a cell to an existing shared resource and creates a
styled empty record when necessary; `reset_style` removes only the explicit
local reference. Shared format definitions remain immutable in this slice, so
editing/forking a resource and reporting its prospective selection-wide
fan-out remain separate future operations.

Cell edit plans now represent payload and local-style effects as orthogonal
facets. Independent edits may join on the same cell when one changes content
and the other changes style; two payload effects, two style effects, or a
whole-cell removal still conflict deterministically. Commit moves accepted
actions into the rewrite plan instead of cloning their content. The XML surgery
rewrites only the touched cell tag for style-only changes, preserving its
payload, metadata, extensions, unknown attributes, and untouched bytes. Patch
states are now a data-bearing enum that makes invalid combinations
unrepresentable: a cell state always contains both content and exact local
style state, while a missing state contains neither. Tests cover local versus
resolved semantics, stored-cell fan-out, styled empty cells, reset, inverse
byte restoration, foreign-lineage rejection, malformed style graphs/tables,
same-cell threaded joins, and composed payload/style rewrites.

For native evidence, Excel for macOS applied bold formatting to `A1` and saved
the source workbook itself. The public `copy_style` example opened that native
file, obtained `A1` through `Sheet::style`, set `C1` to `42`, retargeted `C1`
with the borrowed handle, and atomically saved the result. Excel opened the
result without a repair or compatibility dialog, reported the used range as
`A1:C1`, exposed `A1` and `C1` as bold while `B1` remained plain, and showed
`42` at `C1`. The retained worksheet XML independently showed the same opaque
shared-style reference on `A1` and `C1`. This verifies native interpretation of
one existing shared cell format and the public retarget path; it does not yet
certify shared-format definition editing, every formatting component, or a
native resave of the Litchi-produced output.

The eighth implementation slice adds a semantic rectangular selector to
`litchi-sheet`. `Area` accepts an A1 cell/range as the primary entry, raw
zero-based half-open bounds as a convenience, or a reusable checked `Rect`.
`Rect::from_a1`, `FromStr`, compact display, single-cell construction, and
union all preserve the grid bounds in the type. Parsing follows the checked-in
`[MS-OE376]` §2.1.1119 Office grammar: one cell or two ordered cell references
separated by a colon. `Sheet::cells` now accepts these selector forms directly,
so sparse traversal can use `sheet.cells("B2:F20")` without constructing an
intermediate range or risking an indexing panic.

Each lazily loaded worksheet now computes a borrowed `Extents` view in the same
pass that builds its sparse cell store. It keeps producer-declared `dimension`,
all stored cell records, known/unknown content cells, and cells with explicit
local styles distinct; `used` is the union of direct content and direct cell
formatting and explicitly excludes row/column defaults. The parser validates a
single bounded direct `dimension` before `sheetData`; missing `ref`, reversed or
out-of-grid references, duplicates, and invalid order are rejected. This keeps
a producer hint available for diagnostics without treating it as authoritative
cell content.

New workbooks carry the conventional `A1` dimension. When an ordinary cell
commit creates a stored record outside an existing declared range, the XML
surgery expands that range and preserves its prefix, unknown attributes, and
surrounding bytes. It never narrows a producer range on clear/removal and does
not invent a missing dimension, because row/column formatting and other used-
range contributors are not modeled yet. Inverse patches retain the original
part bytes exactly. The rewrite action and payload types no longer implement
`Clone`; commit moves the accepted ordered maps through row partitioning, so a
future regression cannot silently reintroduce whole cell-content copies at
that boundary. Semantic before/after patch states still clone their owned
values intentionally. The public edit example produced `A1:D4`, serialized the
matching dimension, and the public open example recovered the same four sparse
cell records and extent categories. These type and functional checks do not
establish an allocation or latency result.

Desktop Excel for macOS opened that eighth-slice artifact without a repair or
compatibility prompt, reported its used range as A1:D4, displayed the A1 text
and B2 number, and exposed C3 as a formula evaluating to 84. This is native
evidence that the tested Excel build accepts the conservatively expanded
dimension and stored records in this artifact. It does not certify dimension
shrinking, an Office resave of this exact artifact, other producers, or other
worksheet feature families.

The ninth implementation slice adds checked row-visibility reads and
transactional updates without conflating them with destructive row insertion
or deletion. `RowAt` accepts a
checked coordinate or a raw zero-based index, while `Sheet::row` returns a
borrowed `row::Row` for every logical grid row and preserves the distinction
between an implicit default row and an explicit stored `<row>` record.
`Sheet::rows` lazily visits only explicit records. The coordinate type is
re-exported as `RowIndex`, leaving the short `Row` name for the semantic view.
The parser accepts the SpreadsheetML boolean forms for `hidden` and rejects
malformed values. This follows the checked-in `[MS-OE376]` §2.1.1788 note that
row hiding is represented by the `row` element's `hidden` attribute rather than
the unrelated comment-row marker.

Transactions select the same checked row through `sheet.row(index)?` and expose
the short verbs `hide` and `show`. Hiding an implicit row creates one sparse
empty row record; showing an implicit row is a no-op. Touched row tags retain
their namespace prefix, unknown attributes, children, and cell payloads, while
untouched bytes remain exact. Protected sheets return a typed row-edit block.
`Change` and `Conflict` are now non-exhaustive data-bearing enums separating
cell and row effects: visibility edits on the same row conflict, but a cell
payload and row visibility on that row are independent and may join. Reversible
patches record `Missing` versus `Stored { hidden }` row states and restore the
original package bytes. Recalculation invalidation and calculation-chain
removal now occur only when primary cell content actually changes; row
visibility and style-only transactions preserve those unrelated parts.

The public row example produced an A1:A3 workbook with row index 1 hidden.
Desktop Excel for macOS opened it without repair, displayed row headers 1 and 3
as adjacent to hidden cells while omitting row 2, and reported A1:A3 as the used
range. Excel then changed A3 and resaved the workbook. ZIP validation passed,
and the public Litchi reader recovered the Excel-authored A3 text, all three
cell values, and the hidden row state. This certifies this hide/read/native-
resave path on the tested Excel build; it does not certify other row properties,
column visibility, protected-sheet permission exceptions, or structural shifts.

The tenth implementation slice adds checked column-property reads and
transactional visibility updates. `ColumnAt` accepts a reusable checked
coordinate or a raw zero-based index; `Sheet::column` returns a borrowed
semantic `Column` for every grid position, while `Sheet::columns` lazily visits
only logical columns covered by explicit effective property records. The short
`Column` name is reserved for that view and the coordinate is re-exported as
`ColumnIndex`. Width is a finite checked `Width` in the Office range `0..=255`;
style references, outline levels, and boolean flags are validated before the
view is published. `Sheet::column_style` exposes a shared resource handle or
the explicit default state without leaking the physical `style` index. Shared
style fan-out continues to count stored cells only and does not silently fold
column defaults into its existing contract.

Excel's interpretation of overlapping producer records was established with a
desktop probe before implementing the resolver. For a hidden B:D record
followed by a C-only record that omitted `hidden`, Excel displayed B and D as
hidden and C as visible, then normalized the file on save into three disjoint
records. The parser therefore treats the last matching `<col>` as the complete
effective record; omitted fields in that later record do not inherit from an
earlier overlap. A bounded fixed-grid interval assignment tree applies each
record without work proportional to its covered width and compacts the result
into disjoint borrowed ranges. This is an algorithmic bound, not a measured
latency or allocation claim.

Transactions use `sheet.column(index)?.hide()` and `show()`. Hiding an implicit
column creates a narrow sparse record; showing an implicit column is a no-op.
For an existing range, byte surgery identifies the last physical owner of each
edited coordinate, splits only that owner, changes only `min`, `max`, and
`hidden`, and retains widths, styles, outline state, unknown attributes,
namespace prefixes, untouched records, and `sheetData` bytes. Adjacent new
hidden columns coalesce. A split that would duplicate an unmodeled child
payload, or insertion into an unmodeled `cols` payload, returns a typed markup-
compatibility block. Protected sheets return a distinct typed column block.
The rewritten worksheet is semantically reparsed before the new snapshot is
published.

Column changes and conflicts have their own checked state and coordinate
variants. Two visibility effects on the same column conflict; cell, row, and
column facets remain orthogonal and can be prepared on separate `Edit` values
and joined without exposing locks. Patch inversion restores exact source part
bytes. Unit tests cover complete overlap replacement, malformed bounds and
properties, shared-style reference validation, prefix/attribute preservation,
lossless interval splitting, implicit insertion, protected sheets, extension
blocks, no-op filtering, inverse restoration, checked bounds, and disjoint
joins.

The public column example produced an A1:C1 workbook with column index 1
hidden. Desktop Excel for macOS opened it without a repair or compatibility
dialog, displayed A and C as adjacent headers, omitted B, and reported A1:C1 as
the used range. Excel changed C1, saved the workbook, and normalized the hidden
record to width zero. ZIP validation passed; the public Litchi reader recovered
all three cell values, the Excel-authored C1 text, and the hidden column state.
This certifies this hide/read/native-resave path on the tested Excel build; it
does not certify column width editing, outline/style authoring, structural
column shifts, protected-sheet permission exceptions, or other Office builds.

These slices do not yet shrink or synthesize absent worksheet `dimension`
hints or implement row/column properties beyond visibility, row and column
insertion/deletion, shifting references, merge/group-formula edits,
validation evaluation, shared-style definition editing or forking, named-style
and row/column/theme resolution, rich text, dynamic arrays, patch serialization,
full structured diagnostics, eviction/resource budgets, range/structural effect
joins, three-way merge, raw-copy preservation of clean compressed entries,
cancellation-aware save contexts, scratch planning, or output budgets. Those
remain certification work; no allocation, latency, contention, or scaling
conclusion follows from the functional tests.

## Evidence levels

For each applicable object/scenario, track:

1. read and extraction;
2. create, update, clear/remove, and structural dependencies;
3. lossless preservation of unsupported content;
4. schema/specification validation;
5. native Microsoft Office open without repair;
6. native Office edit and resave;
7. reverse-read with expected semantic and package diffs;
8. single-thread and multi-thread performance evidence where relevant.

Office verification uses generated and curated fixtures on current Windows and
macOS desktop Office plus pinned compatibility baselines. Web Office is
supplemental. Resave comparison permits only a reviewed metadata allowlist;
repair logs, inserted repair parts, missing content, or unexplained semantic
diffs fail.

## Baseline regression disposition

Computer Use verification exposed three destructive or repair-inducing
behaviors. Phase one applies safe containment while the lossless transaction
model is built:

- Opened XLSX mutation formerly entered a fresh writer workbook and could
  discard existing sheets and rows. `worksheet_mut` now returns a typed
  `UnsafeEdit`, and `save` rejects other legacy rebuild paths before creating
  the destination.
- Opened PPTX mutation formerly entered an empty presentation writer and could
  discard existing slides. `presentation_mut` now returns a typed `UnsafeEdit`.
- Newly created PPTX files formerly shared the slide-master theme with the
  notes master, causing desktop PowerPoint to repair the package. Notes now own
  `theme2.xml`, handouts reserve `theme3.xml`, and package-graph regression tests
  pin the relationships.

These guards prevent silent loss; they are not the final lossless edit API.
The umbrella detection/open path and concrete readers also still disagree on
some enabled spreadsheet formats and remain migration work.

Post-fix desktop PowerPoint verification on macOS opened a generated one-slide
artifact without a repair dialog. PowerPoint then added a second slide and
saved the file; Litchi reverse-read both slides, and the resaved package retained
only the intended `theme1.xml` and distinct notes `theme2.xml` theme parts.

Desktop Excel verification on macOS opened the deterministic workbook emitted
by the second slice without a repair or compatibility dialog. Excel accepted an
edit to cell A1 and saved the workbook; the Office-resaved archive passed ZIP
integrity checks. After the third slice, the public sparse cell facade
reverse-read A1 from that same Office-resaved artifact as the exact text
`"Office round trip"`. This certifies minimal-package creation, one native Excel
edit/resave, catalog recovery, shared-string resolution, and semantic readback
for that cell. It does not certify Litchi-authored cell create/update/clear/remove
or general Excel compatibility.

For the fourth slice, desktop Excel on macOS opened a Litchi-authored workbook
containing text at A1, the number 42 at B2, the formula `=B2*2` at C3, and an
explicit empty D4 without a repair or compatibility dialog. Excel reported the
used range as A1:D4. The current Excel session was configured for manual
calculation, so verification explicitly pressed F9; C3 then displayed 84 while
the formula bar retained `=B2*2`. Excel resave normalized the unstyled empty D4
away, materialized the formula cache as 84, and added producer-owned theme,
style, shared-string, and calculation-chain parts. This is reviewed producer
normalization, not evidence that an explicit empty record survives an Office
round trip.

Litchi reverse-read that Office-resaved artifact with the expected A1, B2, and
C3 semantics, edited it again, removed the stale calculation chain, and
preserved the unrelated Office-added parts. Excel then opened this
second-generation artifact without repair, again reported A1:D4, retained the
exact C3 formula, and produced 84 after F9. Together these checks certify this
ordinary-cell set/clear/remove slice on the tested macOS Excel build, including
one Office-resave/re-edit cycle. They do not certify other spreadsheet CRUD
families, automatic calculation under a manual application setting, Windows
Office, older Office versions, or performance.

The worksheet parser also matches checked-in Apache POI and LibreOffice shared-
formula fixtures, including translated follower expressions and stored cached
results. Synthetic tests cover missing versus explicit empty cells, grid-bound
rejection, malformed shared-formula groups, exact numeric lexemes, sparse range
order, read-only serialization stability, and concurrent first access. These
are read-path regression gates, not performance evidence; allocation, latency,
contention, and scaling claims still require the measurement work in ADR 0005.

## Quality gates

- Stable Rust with workspace MSRV 1.89. The initial 1.85 placeholder was
  corrected because the workspace deliberately uses Rust 2024 `let` chains
  (stable in 1.88) and its measured x86 acceleration path uses stable AVX-512
  target features and intrinsics (stable in 1.89). Later bumps require a
  concrete safety, ergonomic, or measured-performance reason.
- Windows, macOS, and Linux CI; WASM where the selected I/O/crypto stack permits.
  `no_std` is not an initial support promise.
- Unit, integration, property, fuzz, Miri, sanitizer, malformed-corpus, and
  dependency-direction checks appropriate to each layer.
- Representative performance and resource budgets as defined by ADR 0005.
- Generated low-level schemas/records are deterministic, checked in, reviewed,
  and cite the source specification. Ergonomic facades remain handwritten.
