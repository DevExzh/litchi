# Soapberry Zip

This is a forked version of [nickbabcock/rawzip](https://github.com/nickbabcock/rawzip) that mainly focuses on Office document formats (OOXML, ODF, iWork). We have removed the unneeded features and focused on performance and simplicity.

Thanks for the original work! The original crate is licensed under MIT and you can obtain it from [here](https://github.com/nickbabcock/rawzip/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
