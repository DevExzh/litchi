# Native iWork fixtures

These compact fixtures were created with the native macOS iWork applications
on 2026-08-07 and are intentionally checked in as package-level compatibility
fixtures.

| File | Expected semantic content |
| --- | --- |
| `pages/basic.pages` | `Litchi native Pages fixture`, `Buffa lazy-view migration verification`, `2026-08-07` |
| `numbers/basic.numbers` | Cell `B2`: `Litchi native Numbers fixture`; cell `B3`: number `42` |
| `keynote/basic.key` | One slide containing `Litchi native Keynote fixture`, `Buffa lazy-view migration verification`, and `2026-08-07` |

Each document was saved, closed, and reopened in Pages, Numbers, or Keynote.
The application accessibility tree confirmed the expected content after the
reopen and no repair prompt was shown. The format-crate integration tests also
open the packages from disk and from borrowed archive bytes.
